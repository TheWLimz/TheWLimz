# Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Being a part of the Bangkit Academy cohort, I am developing my skills in mobile development using Kotlin and Android Jetpack, as well as learning about UI/UX design, soft skills, and English. I am also working on a capstone project with a team of six members from different learning paths, such as cloud computing and machine learning, to create a real-world application that solves a problem. I am grateful for this opportunity to learn from the best mentors and instructors from Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, and Traveloka, and to earn a certification from them.
