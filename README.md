### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a 6th semester Computer Science student that is highly motivated and adaptable professional that specializes in Mobile and Web Development. I bring an idea to life solving problem with the use of Mobile and Web technologies.

With strong background in technical fields, I'm able to develop the prototyping concept into a real application. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to push the boundaries of what's possible and bring my stories to life in new and innovative ways, and also I'm looking forward to work with other people .
