## I'm Felix Winston

Hello, I am an Informatics Engineering student at Universitas Mikroskil who loves to learn and has a high curiosity and good problem-solving skills. I'm currently taking part in Bangkit 2023 by Google, GoTo and Traveloka.

I also like to learn new things through online courses. I am good at English, reading, listening, writing, speaking (beginner-intermediate), and Indonesian natively
