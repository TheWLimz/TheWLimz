### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Felix Winston



I am an Informatics Engineering student at Universitas Mikroskil who loves to learn and has a high curiosity and good problem-solving skills. I'm currently taking part in Bangkit 2023 by Google, GoTo and Traveloka.
I often work on coursework projects for both mid-semester and final projects, so I have good communication skills and can work in a team and independently. I also like to learn new things through online courses. I am also good at English, reading, listening, writing, speaking (beginner-intermediate), and Indonesian natively
